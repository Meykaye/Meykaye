> *building things, breaking them, and fixing them better*

I’m a developer who enjoys building reliable systems and turning ideas into projects that actually work. I like learning by building things from scratch, understanding how they work, and improving them over time.

My main interests are backend development, DevOps workflows, and game development, especially where code and creativity come together.

---

## What I Enjoy Building

- Backend systems that are clear, structured, and easy to maintain  
- DevOps setups like CI/CD pipelines, containerized services, and cloud workflows  
- Game systems and tools such as mechanics, dialogue systems, and reusable components  
- Learning-focused projects where understanding matters more than speed  

Most of my projects start small and grow as I refine and improve them.
